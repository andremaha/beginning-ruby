#= A Dungeon Text Adventure 
#
#== History
# 
#Text adventures were popular in the _1980s_, but have fallen out of favor with modern gamers seeking grafical
#thrills. They're *perfect playgrounds* for experimenting with classes and objects, though, as replicating the real
#world in a virtual form requires a complete understanding of mapping real-world concepts into classes.
